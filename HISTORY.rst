Release History
===============

1.1.0 (release-candidate)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Support for Python 2.7 \(>_<)/
- Added new error `errors.AMQPClientShutdown` as a wrapper for `KeyboardInterrupt` to better handle interrupt handling.

- Added additional handling of keyboard interrupt at the C level to clean up annoying warnings.


1.0.3 (2018-09-14)
++++++++++++++++++

- Reduced CPU load during idle receive.
- Updated Azure uAMQP C and Azure C Shared Utility dependencies.


1.0.2 (2018-09-05)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed additional bugs in setting MessageProperties as string or bytes.
- Removed auth locking to prevent locking issues on keyboard interrupt.


1.0.1 (2018-08-29)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added some more checks in place to prevent lock hanging on a keybaord interrupt.
- Fixed bug in setting MessageProperties.subject as string or bytes.
- `uamqp.send_message` now returns a list of `uamqp.constants.MessageState` to indicate the success of each message sent.


1.0.0 (2018-08-20)
++++++++++++++++++

- API settled.
- **Behaviour change** When a SendClient or SendClientAsync is shutdown, any remaining pending messages (that is messages
  in the states `WaitingToBeSent` and `WaitingForSendAck`) will no longer be cleared, but can be retrieved from a new
  attribute `SendClient.pending_messages` in order to be re-processed as needed.
- **Behaviour change** The function `SendClient.queue_message` now allows for queueing multiple messages at once by simply
  passing in additional message instances:

    - `send_client.queue_message(my_message)`
    - `send_client.queue_message(message_1, message_2, message_3)`
    - `send_client.queue_message(*my_message_list)`

- An authentication object will now raise a `ValueError` if one attempts to use it for more than one connection.
- Renamed internal `_async` module to non-private `async_ops` to allow for docs generation.
- Reformatted logging for better performance.
- Added additional logging.


0.2.1 (2018-08-06)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed potential crashing in bindings for amqpvalue.
- Fixed bindings fault in cbs PUT token complete callback.
- Updated uAMQP-C.
- Added additional auth and connection locking for thread/async safety.
- Increased INFO level logging.
- Removed platform deinitialization until it can be improved.
- Added handling for a connection reaching a client-caused error state.


0.2.0 (2018-07-25)
++++++++++++++++++

- **Breaking change** `MessageSender.send_async` has been renamed to `MessageSender.send`, and
  `MessageSenderAsync.send_async` is now a coroutine.
- **Breaking change** Removed `detach_received` callback argument from MessageSender, MessageReceiver,
  MessageSenderAsync, and MessageReceiverAsync in favour of new `error_policy` argument.
- Added ErrorPolicy class to determine how the client should respond to both generic AMQP errors
  and custom or vendor-specific errors. A default policy will be used, but a custom policy can
  be added to any client by using a new `error_policy` argument. Value must be either an instance
  or subclass of ErrorPolicy.

    - The `error_policy` argument has also been added to MessageSender, MessageReceiver, Connection, and their
      async counterparts to allow for handling of link DETACH and connection CLOSE events.
    - The error policy passed to a SendClient determines the number of message send retry
      attempts. This replaces the previous `constants.MESSAGE_SEND_RETRIES` value which is now
      deprecated.
    - Added new ErrorAction object to determine how a client should respond to an error. It has
      three properties: `retry` (a boolean to determine whether the error is retryable), `backoff`
      (an integer to determine how long the client should wait before retrying, default is 0) and
      `increment_retries` (a boolean to determine whether the error should count against the maximum
      retry attempts, default is `True`). Currently `backoff` and `increment_retries` are only
      considered for message send failures.
    - Added `VendorConnectionClose` and `VendorLinkDetach` exceptions for non-standard (unrecognized)
      connection/link errors.

- Added support for HTTP proxy configuration.
- Added support for running async clients synchronously.
- Added keep-alive support for connection - this is a background thread for a synchronous
  client, and a background async function for an async client. The keep-alive feature is
  disabled by default, to enable, set the `keep_alive_interval` argument on the client to
  an integer representing the number of seconds between connection pings.
- Added support for catching a Connection CLOSE event.
- Added support for `Connection.sleep` and `ConnectionAsync.sleep_async` to pause the connection.
- Added support for surfacing message disposition delivery-state (with error information).
- Added `constants.ErrorCodes` enum to map standard AMQP error conditions. This replaces the previous
  `constants.ERROR_CONNECTION_REDIRECT` and `constants.ERROR_LINK_REDIRECT` which are now both
  deprecated.
- Added new super error `AMQPError` from which all exceptions inherit.
- Added new `MessageHandlerError` exception, a subclass of `AMQPConnectionError`, for
  Senders/Receivers that enter an indeterminate error state.
- `MessageException` is now a subclass of `MessageResponse`.
- Added `ClientMessageError` exception, a subclass of `MessageException` for send errors raised client-side.
- Catching Link DETACH event will now work regardless of whether service returns delivery-state.
- Fixed bug where received messages attempting to settle on a detached link crashed the client.
- Fixed bug in amqp C DescribedValue.
- Fixed bug where client crashed on deallocating failed management operation.


0.1.1 (2018-07-14)
++++++++++++++++++

- Removed circular dependency in Python 3.4 with types.py/utils.py
- When a header properties is not set, returns `None` rather than raising ValueError.
- Fixed bug in receiving messages with application properties.


0.1.0 (2018-07-05)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed bug in error handling for CBS auth to invalid hostname.
- Changed C error logging to debug level.
- Bumped uAMQP C version to 1.2.7
- Fixed memory leaks and deallocation bugs with Properties and Annotations.


0.1.0rc2 (2018-07-02)
+++++++++++++++++++++

- **Breaking change** Submodule `async` has been renamed to the internal `_async`.
  All asynchronous classes in the submodule can now be accessed from uamqp or uamqp.authentication directly.
- **Breaking change** Anything returned by a callback supplied to receive messages will now be ignored.
- **Breaking change** Changed message state enum values:

    - `Complete -> SendComplete`
    - `Failed -> SendFailed`
    - `WaitingForAck -> WaitingForSendAck`

- Added new message state enum values:

    - `ReceivedUnsettled`
    - `ReceivedSettled`

- **Breaking change** Changes to message settlement exceptions:

    - Combined the `AbandonMessage` and `DeferMessage` exceptions as `MessageModified` to be in keeping with the AMQP specification.
    - Renamed `AcceptMessage` to `MessageAccepted`.
    - Renamed `RejectMessage` to `MessageRejected` which now takes `condition` and `description` arguments rather than `message`.

- Added `errors.LinkDetach` exception as new subclass of `AMQPConnectionError` as a wrapped for data in a Link DETACH dispostition.
- Added `errors.LinkRedirect` as a specific subclass of `LinkDetach` to decode the specific redirect fields of a Link Redirect response.
- Added `errors.MessageAlreadySettled` exception for operations performed on a received message that has already returned a receipt dispostition.
- Added `errors.MessageReleased` exception.
- Added `errors.ErrorResponse` exception.
- A received Message can now be explicitly settled through a set of new functions on the message:

    - `Message.accept()`
    - `Message.reject(condition:str, description:str)`
    - `Message.release()`
    - `Message.modify(failed:bool, deliverable:bool, annotations:dict)`

- Added explicit `auto_complete` argument to `ReceiveClient` and `ReceiveClientAsync`. If `auto_complete` is set to `False` then all messages must be
  explicitly "accepted" or "rejected" by the user otherwise they will timeout and be released. The default is `True`, which is the exiting behaviour for each receive mechanism:

    - Received messages processed by callback (`ReceiveClient.receive_messages()`) will be automatically "accepted" if no explicit response has been set on completion of the callback.
    - Received messages processed by batch (`ReceiveClient.receive_message_batch()`) will by automatically "accepted" before being returned to the user.
    - Received messages processed by iterator (`ReceiveClient.receive_message_iter()`) will by automatically "accepted" if no explicit response has been set once the generator is incremented.

- Added new methods to clients and connections to allow to redirect to an alternative endpoint when a LinkRedirect exception is raised.
  The client redirect helper cannot be used for clients that use a shared connection - the clients must be closed before the connection can be redirected.
  New credentials must be supplied for the new endpoint. The new methods are:

    - `uamqp.Connection.redirect(redirect_info, auth)`
    - `uamqp.async.ConnectionAsync.redirect_async(redirect_info, auth)`
    - `uamqp.SendClient.redirect(redirect_info, auth)`
    - `uamqp.ReceiveClient.redirect(redirect_info, auth)`
    - `uamqp.async.SendClientAsync.redirect_async(redirect_info, auth)`
    - `uamqp.async.ReceiveClientAsync.redirect_async(redirect_info, auth)`

- Added `on_detach_received` argument to `Sender` and `Receiver` classes to pass in callback to run on Link DETACH.
- Removed automatic char encoding for strings of length 1, and added `types.AMQPChar` for explicit encoding.
- Bumped uAMQP C version to 1.2.5
- Bumped Azure C Shared Utility to 1.1.5
- Fixed memory leaks in MessageProperties, MessageHeader and message annotations.
